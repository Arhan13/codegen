You will be provided a small AI chat-based application that outputs React components given a user prompt, like a simple vibe-code tool. The application is simple, and is prompted to only produce simple isolated components. The components will be outputted into an preview component, and can be seen right in the browser.

## Backend Portion

Please also complete the backend portion as described in the document. The link to the code is here: localization-manager-backend.

## Documentation
